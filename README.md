CMPSC/MATH 451Web: Numerical Computation, Course Syllabus
Instructor: Wen Shen, Professor, Department of Mathematics.  
Prerequisites: 3 credits for programming + MATH 230/231. In words, calculus (Math 230/231), and some basic programming knowledge. You would also need some linear algebra (Math 220) and  some Differential equations (Math 250/251). Existing knowledge on Matlab will make the course easier. 
Students may take only one course for credit from CMPSC/MATH 451  and CMPSC/Math 455/456.  Students wishing to learn more detailed knowledge  about numerical analysis and scientific computing may consider to take the sequence CMPSC/Math 455-456.  
Textbook:  (required) Wen Shen. An Introduction to Numerical Computation.  1st or 2nd edition. World Scientific, 2016 or 2020.
Copyrights of Course Material. All course materials are copyright protected, where the instructor owns the copyright.  You may download the  video handouts, homeworks and answers etc, for the use within this course. Any sharing of the content outside this course is strictly prohibited, and is a violation of academic integrity. 
 
Class Format: This is an online course, and all instructions occur on Canvas. Recorded videos are posted in Canvas, in the Modules for the corresponding week.
There are two sets of videos.
One set is a live-recoding of my lectures, where you can watch me writing out everything on the blackboard, with the pace of a classroom teaching. These videos are available through YouTube, and might not be available in China and places that do not support YouTube.
Another set consists of power-point presentations, where you only hear my voice and see the power point file. These videos are shorter, but with maybe a bit faster paced, since it’s already typeset. These videos are build in on Canvas, and are available everywhere in the world. Powerpoint Handouts are available for all of these videos. 
You should give both of them a trial, to see which format you like better.
 
Online Office Hour: Online office hours will be held by the TA via Zoom. Details to be announced.
 
Online proctoring. We will use HonorLock to proctor the online exams in this course, including one midterm and one final exam.  More details and rehearsal quiz with HonorLock will be announced on Canvas. 
 
Internet and computer specs. This is an online course, and all the learning and assessments occur online through Canvas. It is the students responsibility to make sure that stable high speed internet is available throughout the course period.  This is particularly important to students that are in a foreign country during the semester.  Assessments (such as quizzes and exams) are also conducted online. Web cam and certain specs must be met for the online proctoring process.  If you shall realize that you can NOT meet these requirements,  we recommend you to drop the course before the drop deadline. 
 
Course Content: The course covers various basic topics on numerical computation. 
•	 Introduction and some background: Representation of numbers in different bases, Floating point representation, Loss of significance,  Review of Taylor series.
•	Algorithms for polynomial interpolation:  Lagrange form,   Newton's form,   Existence and uniqueness,  Error estimates.
•	Spline: Linear spline, Natural cubic spline.
•	Numerical integration: Trapezoid Rule, Simpson's scheme, Adaptive Trapezoid rule,     Romberg Algorithm,  Adaptive recursive Simpson's scheme.
•	Roots of nonlinear equations:  Bisection method, Fixed point iteration,    Newton's iteration,    Secant method.
•	Systems of linear equations:  Direct methods (Simple Gauss elimination, Gauss elimination with partial pivoting,  Tridiagonal and banded systems, LU factorization),  Fixed-point iterative methods (Jacobi method, Gauss Seidel method, SOR method).
•	Method of least squares (smoothing of data):  Linear least square,    Some  quasilinear and nonlinear examples.
•	Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations:  Taylor series methods, Runge-Kutta methods (Euler, Heun, RK4),   Adaptive RK method, Multi-step methods.
•	 System of ordinary differential equations: Methods for first order systems, Higher order equations and systems.
•	 Two-point boundary value problems, shooting method and finite difference method.
•	Finite difference method for some partial differential equations, including: Laplace equation in 2D and heat equation in 1D. 
The course emphasizes on  computational properties and algorithm implementation. Matlab will be used as the programming tool for the computer projects of the course. Learning to use Matlab will be an important part of the course. 
A few words  on programming: Programming will be an important part of the course.  Every method and algorithm we learn will be coded in Matlab. If you do not have any experience in programming, it will be a serious drawback.  In this course we offer guide/tutorial only on specific programming details in Matlab, which is not  suitable for complete coding beginners. 
Online Discussion Forum Through Canvas. We encourage the usage of the online discussion forum through Canvas.  Every student must join the Canvas group for this course. You may post questions regarding the videos, home work problems, weekly quizzes, and any questions you may have on Canvas.Students are encouraged to answer any questions asked by their fellow students. If you shall have any confidential questions regarding grades etc, you should send a personal message to the instructor through Canvas. 
Homework.  Homework is individual assignment. Each student should submit their own independent work. 
Homework is assigned weekly, and submitted on Canvas. Please submit individual files. Please do NOT submit zip file. 
Make sure to submit  your Matlab source code (functions and script files), along with the results of your program (data output, plots etc),  We will need to verify if your code works. If you use LaTeX (see below), please submit both the tex source file and the pdf-file.   Please do not email the instructor or the TA with homework submissions. For data safety we do not open email attachments. 
All problems in a homework set must be completed, but only a few  selected problems will be graded. The home submissions will be checked for completion as well; any incomplete homework submission will only receive partial credits. Following the general policy,  late home works would NOT  be accepted with any excuses. Any missing homework will receive a grade of 0 point.
There are 11 homework assignments. Each homework is worth 40 points. The lowest homework grade will be dropped.  Total points for all homework sets is 400. 
LaTeX: We encourage the students to typeset their home works with LaTeX,  a typesetting tool specially suitable for mathematical writings. Various bonus points will be given to each homework typeset in LaTeX. (Bonus points are only for LaTeX-typesetting, not for other typesetting forms.)  If you are interested,  please see the LaTeX resources posted on Canvas.
Scan app. We recommend you to use the free APP  Genius Scan - PDF Scanner or CamScanner, and save your scanned file in PDF format. We  only accept PDF format files, this makes it easier for the grader.
Quizzes. There will be an online quiz on Canvas for each chapter. Each quiz is worth 20 points. You may consider these quizzes as mini-midterm exams. You have only one attempt for each quiz, so please be well prepared before you start the quiz.  Quizzes are individual assessment, and students must take the quiz on their own. Collaboration with quizzes is considered a violation of academic integrity, and will be reported.  No makeup quizzes are allowed.  There are 11 quizzes. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.  Total points for all quizzes is 200. 
Important!  If you wish to review the quiz problems for the final exam, please make sure that you take the quiz. Due to the setup and technical details, review of the quiz is ONLY available to those who have taken the quiz. 
Exams.  There will be a midterm exam and a final exam, each worth 200 points, both proctored by Honorlock. The final exam is not accumulative and only covers the second half of the course. More details will be announced. 
Course Grades guideline: The three categories add up to be a total of 1000 points. Here is the guideline for letter grades cut-off:
 
Letter grades cutoffs
Points range	Letter grade
930  ---  1000 	A

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University's Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students' dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.
In particular, these include:  original individual homework submission,  individual assessment through quizzes, and individual  midterm and final exams. 
There are various cheating services online or in-person (Chegg, CourseHero etc).  The usage of these services is a violation of the academic integrity, and will be prosecuted. 
All violations will be reported to the Integrity Office and handled accordingly.
 
DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION STATEMENT: Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus
